# selfEducation


## Description
Taking my learning into my own hands (rather than shelling out the cash that I don't have for a bootcamp course) by scouring the internet for information and education.

My plan is to follow the track of courses and camps that are available online, then setting out to gather information and create projects based on what I learn. This file will generally be used for planning and organizing what I will be learning.

Much of this will involve the Colt Steele Web Dev Bootcamp 2021 course. (I'm not big on lectures, but I paid for it, so I'm using it.)

(I'll probably even learn how to use Markdown syntax better.)
